naked
=====
Naked is a Python command line application framework that is in development.  It features (1) a client application for automatic project generation with documentation, deployment, and testing project file stubs, and (2) a Python library with an easy to use command line string object parser and numerous Python type/method/function extensions (with the option to compile faster C versions).

A development release is coming in the next couple of weeks.  Documentation development and initial testing is in progress.

Contributions to the code are highly encouraged... will release developer documentation soon.
